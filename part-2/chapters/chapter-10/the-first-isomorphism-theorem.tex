\section{The First Isomorphism Theorem}

\begin{theorem}[First Isomorphism Theorem (Jordan, 1870)]
	Let $\phi$ be a group homomorphism from $G$ to $\overline{G}$. Then the mapping from $G/\ker\phi$ to $\phi(G)$, given by $g\ker\phi \to \phi(g)$, is an isomorphism. In symbols, $G/\ker\phi \approx \phi(G)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{corollary}
	If $\phi$ is a homomorphism from a finite group $G$ to $\overline{G}$, then $\abs{\phi(G)}$ divides $\abs{G}$ and $\abs{\overline{G}}$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{theorem}[Normal Subgroups Are Kernels]
	Every normal subgroup of a group $G$ is the kernel of a homomorphism of $G$. In particular, a normal subgroup $N$ is the kernel of the mapping $g \to gN$ from $G$ to $G/N$.
\end{theorem}
